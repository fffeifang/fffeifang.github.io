abstract = {Efficient vector query processing is essential for powering large-scale AI applications, such as LLMs. However, existing solutions struggle with growing vector datasets that exceed the memory capacity of a single machine, leading to excessive data movement and resource underutilization in monolithic architectures.We introduce d-HNSW, the first vector search engine for RDMA-based disaggregated memory systems. d-HNSW achieves high performance by supporting efficient data indexing with minimal network communication overhead. At its core, d-HNSW introduces a novel disaggregation of the HNSW graph-based vector index, leveraging the properties of greedy search to coordinate data transfers efficiently between the memory and compute pools. Specifically, d-HNSW incorporates three key techniques: (i) Representative index caching, which constructs a lightweight index from a sampled subset of the data and caches it in the compute pool to minimize frequent access to critical components of the hierarchical graph index; (ii) RDMA-friendly data layout, which optimizes data placement to reduce networking round trips for both vector queries and insertions; and (iii) Batched query-aware data loading, which mitigates bandwidth usage between memory and compute pools, addressing the limited cache capacity of compute nodes. The experimental results demonstrate that d-HNSW outperforms Naive d-HNSW implementation by up to 117\texttimes{} in query latency while maintaining a recall of 0.87 on the SIFT1M dataset.},
